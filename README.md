#Data Preperation and Analysis Final 
# Project Title Social Media and Mental Health for Men

## 1. Research Question

I am researching social media and mental health. I choose to evaluate the “gender” column within the dataset. I want to see if there is any difference in the happiness of social media users based on the gender the participate. 

## 2. Hypothesis
Gender has no effect on the happiness of social media users.  
## 3. Data Description
Describe your data source(s):
* Where it comes from (URL, API, dataset name)
	Social Media and Mental Health Balance.
* What each observation represents (unit of analysis)
	User_ID- Nominal Unique ID for each participant in data gathering exercise.
	Age- Continuous Age of each participant.
	Gender – Categorical selection of gender.  
	Daily_Screen)time(hrs) – Continuous number of hours each person uses their phone
	Sleep_Quality(1-10) – Ordinal ranking of sleep 1-10
	Stess_Level (1-10) – Ordinal ranking of stress 1-10
	Days_Without_Socia_Media -  Continuous number of days each person does not use.
	Exercise_Frequenecy(week) -  Continuous number of days each person exercise a week. 
	Social_Media_Platfom -  Categorical selection of social media used. 
	Happiness_Index(1 – 10) – Ordinal ranking of happiness 1-10
* Number of observations and key variables
	There are 10 observations and the key variables is “Happiness_INDEX(1-10)”.
* Any filtering, cleaning, or transformation steps
	No filtering or cleaning. The one transformation I did was creating a observation titled Happiness by creating Happy (10-8), Neutral (6-7), Unhappy (=<5).
## 4. Methods

Summarize how you analyzed the data:

* The test statistic for your permutation test
* How you simulated or resampled under the null hypothesis
* The metric(s) for which you created bootstrap confidence intervals
* Why the CLT does not apply to at least one metric

## 5. Results

Present your main findings:

* Key summary statistics and visualizations
* Observed test statistic and p-value (if applicable)
* Bootstrap confidence intervals for relevant metrics

## 6. Uncertainty Estimation

Discuss your resampling results:

* How many resamples you used
* What the bootstrap or randomization distributions looked like
* How you interpret the interval estimates

## 7. Limitations

Briefly note any limitations in data, assumptions, or methods, including sources of bias or missing data.

## 8. References

List all datasets, tools, libraries, or papers you cited.
